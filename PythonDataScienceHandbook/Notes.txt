1. A Numpy Array essentially contains a single pointer to one contigous block of data.
2. A Python List contains a pointer to a block of pointers, each of which points to a full Python object like Python integer.


Broadcasting:
1. Allows binary operations to be performed on arrays of different sizes.
2. Rules of Broadcasting
i. Rule 1:
- If 2 arrays differ in dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.
ii. Rule 2:
- If the shape of 2 arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match other shape.
iii. Rule 3:
- If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.
